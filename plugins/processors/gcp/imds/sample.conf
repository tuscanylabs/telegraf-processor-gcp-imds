  timeout = "10s"

  ## ordered controls whether or not the metrics need to stay in the same order
  ## this plugin received them in. If false, this plugin will change the order
  ## with requests hitting cached results moving through immediately and not
  ## waiting on slower lookups. This may cause issues for you if you are
  ## depending on the order of metrics staying the same. If so, set this to true.
  ## Keeping the metrics ordered may be slightly slower.
  ordered = false

  ## max_parallel_calls is the maximum number of GCP API calls to be in flight
  ## at the same time.
  ## It's probably best to keep this number fairly low.
  max_parallel_calls = 10

  ## cache_ttl determines how long each cached item will remain in the cache before
  ## it is removed and subsequently needs to be queried for from the GCP API. By
  ## default, no items are cached.
  # cache_ttl = "0s"

  ## tag_cache_size determines how many of the values which are found in imds_tags
  ## will be kept in memory for faster lookup on successive processing of metrics.
  ## This typically does not need to be changed when using the imds_tags field.
  # tag_cache_size = 1000

  ## log_cache_stats will emit a log line periodically to stdout with details of
  ## cache entries, hits, misses, and evacuations since the last time stats were
  ## emitted. This can be helpful in determining whether caching is being effective
  ## in your environment. Stats are emitted every 30 seconds. By default, this
  ## setting is disabled.
  # log_cache_stats = false
